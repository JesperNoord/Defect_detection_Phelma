### Sample configuration file - this one was created for GALATEA camera


#1) column detection settings

# detection_method - 'canny', 'radon', 'histogram' - what algorithm to use to detect edges:
# canny - sensitive to noise, but can find columns in videos, slowest
# radon - using radon transform, can find columns no matter their color, slow
# histogram - simplest method, fastest
# default setting: 'histogram'
detection_method: 'histogram'

# method_threshold: float
# used only for radon and histogram algorithms - says how much the column signal must
# be over mean signal of an image
# default value: 1.24
method_threshold: 1.24

# canny_percentile: float
# used only for canny algorithm - describes how many % of detected columns are discarded
# default value: 95
canny_percentile: 95

#2) preprocessing settings

# columns_per_amplifier: int
# used for describing how many columns are affected by 'broken' amplifier
# so, for galatea and scorpio cameras, this setting = 1
# and for other, columns_per_amplifier = 4
columns_per_amplifier: 1

# preprocessing_methods: list
# used preprocessing methods, stored as list of string. The order of the execution is determined by the sequence in the
# list. Available preprocessing methods:
# - 'equalize_images' - perform histogram equalization
# - 'remove_vignette' - self-explanatory, sometimes after histogram equalization the bounds of an image are visibly darker
# than the middle, this method will try to remove the disproportion - setting essential in daphnis flux file
# - 'blur_img' - convolves image with mean filter
# if list is empty, no preprocessing is applied.
# example: preprocessing_methods: ['equalize_images', 'remove_vignette']
# default value: []
preprocessing_methods: []

#3
remove_vignette: [51]
fragmented_min_distance: 71
